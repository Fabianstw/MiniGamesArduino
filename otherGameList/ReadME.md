## How to use a game

To use one of the games inside this folder. Just open `xyz.ino`, copy the code and paste it into the `../sketch/sketch.ino`. If there are any files (e.g. `h` files) move/copy them into `../sketch/` too. 

### Error warning
Even though there will probably be an error if you open any file inside the folder, it does **not** matter, since this is not the compiling folder. The files will (*should*) work properly inside `../sketch/`.

### Different diagram.json
If your circuit for the game needs other hardware then the predefined components inside `..sketch/digram.json`, please create a subfolder for your game, with the game file and a corresponding `diagram.json`.

### Question
If there are any questions, feel free to ask via **Issues** on GitHub.
